# Contributing Code

Thank you for your interest in participating!

There are many ways to contribute, beyond writing code or programming, by: asking questions, reporting bugs, and suggesting features. To do so, please log a [new issue](https://github.com/shabados/viewer/issues/new).

**This document is for developers or programmers contributing to the source code.**

## Get Started

You will need to create a Google Cloud Project with the Translate API enabled to try out punjabi to english translating.

Translations will be enabled if the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set to a path that contains the credentials for a Google Cloud Project's service account, which you must create. [Learn more about setting up the Google Cloud Project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/translate#quickstart).

### Build

Run `npm i` in the root directory.

### Start

```shell
npm start
```

### Run

Usage:

```shell
npm run <command>
```

Some featured commands:

```shell
test
lint
```

Run `npm run` or open the `package.json` file(s) for a full list of commands.
